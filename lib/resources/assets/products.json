The Achromatic Lenses (achromat) are designed to eliminate chromatic and spherical aberrations inherent in singlet lenses. When used on-axis, an achromatic lens focuses unparallel input beam to a perfect point, limited only by the effects of diffraction. This performance can be achieved over a broadband of wavelength. Achromatic Doublet Lens is used to collimate and focus laser beams. They can also be used for high-quality imaging on-axis.",
